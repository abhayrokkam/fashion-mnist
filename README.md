# Experimentations with Fashion-MNIST Dataset

This repository is focused on training different models on Fashion-MNIST dataset. There will be three different models which will trained, tested and compared on this dataset. The three models chosen will be the three different deep learning techniques a beginner would learn at the start of their 'deep-learning-journey' and this is becasue Fashion-MNIST is a beginner dataset.

The three models for experimentation:
- **Linear Model**: This model will just have dense linear layers with no activation functions.
- **Non-Linear Model**: This model will combine the dense linear layers with non-linear activation functions to provide the model with the ability to learn non-linear patterns in data.
- **Convolutional Model**: This model will use a convolutional neural network with pooling. This model will replicate the Tiny-VGG model that has been visually demonstrated [here]('https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/').
